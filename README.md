## New Computer Setup Instructions

These instructions are, of course, specifc to the tools I like to use.

1. Install and configure Exercism's CLI: https://exercism.org/cli-walkthrough
   It's quick and easy with `brew`!
2. Download the repo from Github:
   `gh repo clone crawfoal/amandas-exercism-solutions ~/Exercism`
3. Start downloading and completing exercises.
